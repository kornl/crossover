searchCrossOverDesign(s, p, v, model = "Standard additive model",
  eff.factor = 1, v.rep, balance.s = FALSE, balance.p = FALSE,
  verbose = 0, model.param = list(), n = c(5000, 20), jumps = c(5,
  50), start.designs, random.subject = FALSE, contrast,

}
\arguments{
\item{s}{Number of sequences.}

\item{p}{Number of periods.}

\item{v}{Number of treatments.}

\item{model}{Model - one of the following: "Standard additive model" (2),
"Second-order carry-over effects" (3), "Full set of interactions" (3),
"Self-adjacency model" (3), "Placebo model" (2), "No carry-over into self
model" (2), "Treatment decay model" (2), "Proportionality model" (1), "No carry-over effects" (0).
The number in parentheses is the number of different efficiency factors that can
be specified.}

\item{eff.factor}{Weights for different efficiency factors. (Not used in the
moment.)}

\item{v.rep}{Integer vector specifying how often each treatment should be
assigned (sum must equal s*p).}

\item{balance.s}{Boolean specifying whether to allocate the treatments as
equally as possible to each sequence (can result in loss of efficiency).}

\item{balance.p}{Boolean specifying whether to allocate the treatments as
equally as possible to each period (can result in loss of efficiency).}

\item{verbose}{Level of verbosity, a number between 0 and 10. The default
\code{verbose=0} does not print any output, while \code{verbose=10} prints
any available notes.}

\item{model.param}{List of additional model specific parameters. In the
moment these are \code{ppp}, the proportionality parameter for the
proportionality model, and \code{placebos}, the number of placebo treatments
in the placebo model.}

\item{n}{\code{n=c(n1,n2)} with \var{n1} the number of hill climbing steps
per trial and \var{n2} the number of searches from random start matrices.}

\item{jumps}{To reduze the possibility of the hill-climbing algorithm to get
stuck in local extrema long jumps of distance \var{d} can be performed all
\var{k} steps. This can be specified as \code{long.jumps=c(d,k)}. If
\var{long.jumps} has only length 1 the default for \var{k} is 50.  If after
\var{k/2} hill-climbing steps the old design criterion is not enhanced (or
at least reached), the algorithm returns to the design from before the jump.}

\item{start.designs}{A single design or a list of start designs. If missing or to few start
designs are specified (with regard to parameter \var{n} which specifies a
number of 20 start designs as default) the start designs are generated
randomly with the sample function. Alternatively
\code{start.designs="catalog"} can be used to take start designs from the
catalog to which random designs are added till \var{n2} start designs are at
hand.}

\item{random.subject}{Should the subject effects be random (\code{random.subject=TRUE})
or fixed effects (\code{random.subject=FALSE}).}

\item{contrast}{Contrast matrix to be optimised. TODO: Example and better
explanation for contrast.}

\item{correlation}{Either a correlation matrix for the random subject effects or one 
of the following character strings: "equicorrelated", "autoregressive"}

\item{rho}{Parameter for the correlation if parameter \code{correlation} is a character string.}
}
\value{
Returns the design as an integer matrix.

\dontrun{
x <- searchCrossOverDesign(s=9, p=5, v=4, model=4)

jumps <- c(10000, 200) # Do a long jump (10000 changes) every 200 steps
n <- c(1000, 5)        # Do 5 trials with 1000 steps in each trial
result <- searchCrossOverDesign(s=9, p=5, v=4, model=4, jumps=jumps, n=n)

- Native routine registration.

- No warnings with testthat 2.0.0.

Changes in version 0.1-16 (23-10-2016)
======================================

- Using testthat instead of RUnit and now compatible with byte-code compiler.

- Warnings regarding missing JRI.jar and use of the GUI inside of RStudio.

Changes in version 0.1-15 (29-07-2015)
======================================

- Fixed errors when more than two users used the Crossover GUI on the same system

- Fixed CRAN warnings

- Improved error dialog

Changes in version 0.1-14 (26-03-2015)
======================================

- Fixed bug with designs from Crossdes

- Extended documentation

Changes in version 0.1-13 (31-10-2014)
======================================

- It is possible to sort the design table (e.g. by efficiency or number of sequences).

- The now easiest and recommended way to access designs from literature is to use
  function 'getDesign' as in: 
    getDesign("williams4t")

- Combination of Clatworthy designs with balanced Williams designs are included.
  Combination of Clatworthy designs with all balanced designs in the archive is available here:
  https://github.com/kornl/crossover/blob/master/build/pbib2combine.rda?raw=true
  (Replace this file in library/Crossover/data/.)
  Due to size they are (not yet) included in the CRAN package.

- Updated documentation

- Efficiencies are now calculated for all models.

- Fixed wrongly disabled input field for placebo/proportional model input parameter.

Changes in version 0.1-12 (25-09-2014)
======================================

- Fixed portable C++ code problem: "Other macros, typically upper-case,
  may be defined by the compiler or system headers and can cause problems. 
  The most common issue involves the names of the Intel CPU registers such
  as CS, DS and SS defined on i586/x64 Solaris in <sys/regset.h> and often 
  included indirectly by <stdlib.h> and other core headers."

- GUI threads analysing the available packages by calling R are stopped until 
  the call to show the GUI has been returned back to R. 
  (Before you could notice "stack imbalance" warnings and complete crashes of R.)

- User is asked whether files should be saved, if new designs were created.

- Less logging output in the R console.

- Removed a few designs that were only building blocks for crossover designs from
  the list of crossover designs.

- Clean-up

Features in version 0.1-11 (05-09-2014)
=======================================

- Solarix x64 support.

Features in version 0.1-10 (27-08-2014)
=======================================

- First version of package on CRAN. 

- More than two hundred cross-over design from literature.

- Search algorithm to find efficient cross-over designs.

- Graphical user interface (GUI) to find/generate appropriate designs.

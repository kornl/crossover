searchCrossOverDesign(s=10, p=3, v=4, model="Full set of interactions", eff.factor=c(1,1,1), contrast="Tukey", balance.s=FALSE, balance.p=FALSE, random.subject=FALSE, n=c(2000,20), verbose=FALSE)

creates design, where carry-over effects are not estimable.

===

estimable for carry-over for Placebo model is off, since there are zero columns.

===

Placebo model with v placebos should be the same as no-carry-over.

Screenshots: t=6, p=4, s=24 -> Standard settings improve not that much any more.

Apart from that: i) Catalogue Williams t=4 (4,4,2), Williams design with screenshot
ii) a) Catalogue t=6, p=4, s=12 See PL design
b) algorithm search screenshot, see above.

Use ggpots "autoplot"? It's S3...

- Customized output - default: Treatment variances, pairwise efficiencies
- Interaction contrasts???
- Default contrasts: Tuckey, Dunnett and weighted combination of both
- exchange rules, for example: every sequence should start with placebo

- estimable_R does not work for full set of interactions:
crossover:::infiniteSearch(oldResult=NULL, s=5, p=4, v=4, model="Full set of interactions", v.rep=c(5,5,5,5), balance.s=FALSE, balance.p=FALSE, verbose=FALSE, n=c(5000, 5), start.designs="catalog")
This problem most likely is in appendZeroColumns(Csub, model, v).

Check whether C and t(C) are not mixed up somewhere. (I guess not, because it would cause problems due to wrong dimensions.)

Why are there sometimes non-monotone parts in the proportionality model?

Move common config code to afcommons. 

Warn if the choosen combination of t, s and p does not 
allow to estimate all parameters due to insufficient degrees of freedom.

(CrossOver algorithm paper claims on page 4 that this is the case for "p = 3, n = 4, t = 4"
e.g. "FLETCHER FACTORIAL 2 x 2 DESIGN 1" for second-order carry-over effects.)

Look at R crossover package

Adaptive crossovers (also taking speed of recruiting into account)

A B C D E
- B A E C D
- - D E A C B
and so on…

when baseline measurements are obtained in each period

Look at http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ExperimentalDesign.html
especially http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/crossdes/index.html

design <- structure(c(1, 5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 2, 4, 3, 7, 9, 5, 4, 8, 10, 6), .Dim = c(4L, 4L))
design.efficiency(design)$av.eff.trt.pair.adj

design <- structure(c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3), .Dim = c(5L, 3L))

Die speziellen Designs finden sich immer zusammengefasst in Paketen bzgl. der Autoren

- Calculations for the model with the full set of interactions are still most certainly wrong.
- Results from package crossdes "CrossDes Search Result for a D-optimal BIBD" don't make much sense and cause problems.
- The contrasts specified in the GUI are currently not passed to R but instead only equally weighted all-pair comparisons only for the treatment effects are assumed. (I forgot to uncomment a line before building...) But in R this should work fine!
- The package gives you not enough credit for your collection of examples and also I included your R-Code for comparison/testing purposes (and also the variances shown in the GUI are currently from general.carryover). 
- Warning if treatment effects are not estimable from design
- More output in catalog - Integers in algorithm design

- Efficiency in output window from algorithm
- Try to find designs from page 203, Jones and Kenward
- Tukey / Dunnett / Factorial (page 195 Jones&Kenward) contrasts
- Own catalogue (or even more than 1 - loaded at start-up) perhaps saved as Rd-file?

I think what we are seeking is the marginal variance-covariance matrix of the
parameter estimators (marginal with respect to the random effects random
variable, B), which would have the form of the inverse of the crossproduct of a
(q+p) by p matrix composed of the vertical concatenation of - L^{-1}RZX RX^{-1}
and RX^{-1}. (Note: You do *not* want to calculate the first term by inverting
L, use solve(L, RZX, system = "L") - [...] don't even think about using
solve(L) - don't!, don't!, don't! - have I made myself clear? - don't do that
(and we all know that someone will do exactly that for a very large L and then
send out messages about "R is SOOOOO SLOOOOW!!!!" :-) )
